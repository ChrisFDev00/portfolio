          While this site exists in its infancy, it will soon serve as my personal website with an admin control centre for the standard CRUD.
          This will be deployed with CI/CD configurations against a test suite to contribute to uptime. <br><br>

          This site will serve as a persistent sandbox for my learning experiences as a publicly documented log of the things I do and learn as a developer. <br></br>

          Now, it is written in Ruby on Rails which I know is hardly the most popular framework, and templates exist for sites like this in CMS-based frameworks like Astor and Umbraco.
          However, I've found the Rails community to be incredibly welcoming to learn from and rails can by default return .json from its controllers.

          As such, when this site looks as it should in its Rails implementation, I will learn subdomains and treat the back-end as a headless API for other front-end frameworks. <br><br>

          Wishing you all the best and I look forward to working with you, <br>
